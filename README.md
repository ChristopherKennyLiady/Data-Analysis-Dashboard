## Project Insights
- Technology products emerge as the most profitable category, highlighting the importance of maintaining innovation and competitive advantage in this segment.
- Middle-income customers form the core of the customer base, suggesting that marketing strategies should balance affordability with retained value.
- Adult customers drive the largest share of sales, indicating that messaging and promotions should align with their purchasing motivations and lifestyle needs.
- Most sales occur without heavy discounts, showing that customers are willing to pay near full price when the perceived value is high.
- Sales activity peaks toward the end of the year, suggesting that seasonal campaigns during this period can deliver significant returns.
- On-time deliveries dominate sales, reinforcing the role of efficient logistics in driving customer satisfaction and repeat purchases.

## Conclusion
To maximize revenue growth, the business should focus on technology product promotion targeting middle-income adult customers during the year-end peak season. Marketing strategies can leverage limited or medium-level discounts to boost sales without significantly affecting margins.
Additionally, improving delivery performance to reduce late shipments could enhance customer satisfaction and retention. A combination of targeted seasonal campaigns, operational efficiency improvements, and customer-segment-focused marketing will help sustain and grow sales performance.
